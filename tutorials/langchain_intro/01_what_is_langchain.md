# What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

## Core Concepts

*   **Components:** The building blocks of LangChain, such as LLMs, Prompts, and Output Parsers.
*   **Chains:** Sequences of components that create a single, coherent application.
*   **Agents:** Chains that use an LLM to decide which actions to take.
