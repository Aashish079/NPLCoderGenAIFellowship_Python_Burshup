# Control Flow

This tutorial covers control flow statements in Python.

## Conditional Statements

`if`, `elif`, and `else` are used for conditional execution:

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
```

## Loops

`for` and `while` loops are used for iteration:

```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
c = 0
while c < 5:
    print(c)
    c += 1
```
